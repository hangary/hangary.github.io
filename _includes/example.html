<h2>Closed Loop Control Quadcopter using Ardupilot Item<h2>
<p>I got a drone from a couple years back and never got a chance to play around with it. I thought that I might as well take it for a whirl and so I did! The drone utilizes a KK Multicopter V5.5 Controller at the moment but I'm looking for an alternative one with telemetry so I can program flight paths. </p>
